### Preparation

Since the bridge actually does not charge any fees, you will **NEED TO manually claim** assets on the other chain regardless of the direction of your cross-chain operation.

Therefore, you need to prepare some BNB as Gas fee.

Reference: [BNB Chain Official Website](https://www.bnbchain.org/en) , "Get BNB ".



In addition, if you have assets in BNB Chain and are ready to enter smartBCH, we offer convenient access to Gas exchange.

By simply checking "Need Gas", you will pay 0.01 BNB as a fee for cross-chain transactions and we will provide you with 0.01 BCH as a Gas fee in the smartBCH network at the same address.

If for some reason the claim is not successful, simply select the correct From and Target chains, switch the network to the Target chain, enter the TxID and click on "CLAIM" to complete the cross-chain process.
